Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is a simple command-line based rock, paper, scissors game built with JavaScript. The game prompts the user to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and then randomly selects the CPU's choice. The game then compares the choices and determines the winner
How to Play
Clone the repository or copy the code into a JavaScript file on your local machine.
Install the prompt-sync package using npm install prompt-sync.
Run the game using node <filename>.js command in your terminal or command prompt.
Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted and press enter.
The game will display the winner (either the user or the CPU) and the choices made by both.
Code
The code for the game is available in the index.js file. The game logic is implemented using a series of if-else statements to compare the choices made by the user and the CPU. The game uses the prompt-sync package to receive input from the user and the Math.random() method to generate a random choice for the CPU.
