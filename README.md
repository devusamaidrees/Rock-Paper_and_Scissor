# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game
This is a simple command-line based rock, paper, scissors game built with JavaScript. The game prompts the user to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and then randomly selects the CPU's choice. The game then compares the choices and determines the winner
# How to Play
##### 1. Clone the repository or copy the code into a JavaScript file on your local machine.
##### 2. Install the prompt-sync package using npm install prompt-sync.
##### 3. Run the game using node <filename>.js command in your terminal or command prompt.
##### 4. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted and press enter.
##### 5. The game will display the winner (either the user or the CPU) and the choices made by both.
# Code
The code for the game is available in the **index.js** file. The game logic is implemented using a series of if-else statements to compare the choices made by the **user** and the **CPU**. The game uses the prompt-sync package to receive input from the user and the **Math.random()** method to generate a random choice for the CPU.
